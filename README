This is a collection of different decorators that implement tail-recursion
in Python.  You probably want to use ctailspin, since it's faster,
though in general you only want to use these at all if you're having
memory or recursion depth issues, because it takes a lot of recursion
for even ctailspin to be faster than normal recursion.

While I came up with the main idea independently, I did later benefit from
crux's decorator at http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1331#comment-15165.
